# Target AWS region, defaults to us-east-1 if not provided.  Note thet some global system components

# The short solution name is used to namespace a few AWS resources. Try to keep this
# setting short to avoid hitting long strings issues; the default should be fine in most cases,
# but if multiple separate instances of the system are deployed within a single account,
# this name can be changed to ensure they are disambiguated.
#solutionName: sw

# The environment name where you want to deploy the solution to. Normally this defaults to
# the serverless stage name and should be left unchanged here.
# This is also used for creating a namespace for resources. Usually, this is same as serverless "stage".
# All resource names reference "envName" instead of directly using "opt:stage".
# This indirection allows for easy incorporation of extra variables in the "envName", if required.
# For example, if the same solution needs to be deployed across multiple AWS accounts we can easily
# add account specific variable in "envName" for keeping the namespace specific to each account.
#envName: ${opt:stage}

# The environment type (e.g. dev, demo, prod). This is for grouping multiple environments
# into types. For example, all developers' environments can be of type "dev". This can be
# used for enabling conditionals in code that might need to be different between dev and
# production builds (for example, enabling CORS for localhost for local development).
# Defaults to prod if unspecified.
#envType: dev

# Enable this to create a Service Catalog portfolio and populate workspace products
# Override and disable this setting if you wish to create your portfolio manually

# Root user's email address. Currently unused, and can be left unspecified for test environments,

# To use a custom domain name, provide the following two values, the domain name
# itself, and the ARN for the manually-created TLS certificate to use from ACM.
# Note the current implementation assumes that DNS is handled elsewhere; a future
# improvement will automatically handle creation of the cert and Route53 entries.
#domainName: sw.example.com

# Array of identity provider ids.
# The usual practice is to keep this same as the domain name of the idp.
# For example, when connecting with an IdP that has users "user1@example.com", "user2@example.com" etc then
# the id should be set to "example.com"
#
# If you do not want to connect to Active Directory then leave this setting as its default.
#fedIdpIds: '["datalake.example.com"]'

# Array of identity provider names. This array should be in same order as the "fedIdpIds"
# Some name for the IdPs. (such as 'com.ee', 'EEAD' etc)
#
# If you do not want to connect to Active Directory then leave this setting as its default.
#fedIdpNames: '["DataLake"]'

# Array of identity provider display names. This array should be in same order as the "fedIdpIds"
# Display name (such as 'Employee Login', 'AD Login' etc). This can be used in UI to login options.
#
# If you do not want to connect to Active Directory then leave this setting as its default.
#fedIdpDisplayNames: '["Login using Active Directory"]'

# Array of identity provider SAML metadata. This array should be in same order as the "fedIdpIds".
# The array should contain either
# 1. S3 or http(s) url pointing to the IdP metadata.
#  If S3 URL then it must be accessible by the post-deployment lambda
#   (i.e., the lambda must have getObject permission to read the specified metadata file location from S3)
#   The GetObject permission is given by the "RolePostDeploymentLambda" in "post-deployment/config/infra/cloudformation.yml"
#  If it's http(s) URL then it must be reachable over the public internet.
# (TODO: Add support for metadata URLs accessible only in private network.)
# OR
# 2. the metadata content XML blob as string
# The current implementation looks for the file in "solution/post-deployment/config/saml-metadata" directory and
# uploads the file to the S3 directory (prefix) "${self:custom.settings.deploymentBucketName}/saml-metadata/".
# The uploading of the file is done using serverless s3-sync plugin. See "post-deployment/serverless.yml"
# file and search for "s3Sync" to see which files are uploaded to the "${self:custom.settings.deploymentBucketName}" S3
# bucket.
#
# If you do not want to connect to Active Directory then leave this setting as its default.
# TODO: Remove saml-metadata/datalake-example-idp-metadata.xml file and replace this setting to use sample file
