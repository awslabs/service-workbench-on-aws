 * @param payload A free form object. Use this object to add any properties that you need to pass to the App model
 * when it is being initialized. The base-ui addon, makes a property named 'tokenInfo' available on this payload object.
 * @param appContext An application context object containing various Mobx Stores, Models etc.
