### [5.2.0](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/compare/v5.1.1...v5.2.0) (2022-05-17)


### Features

* TRE Enhancements  ([#993](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/issues/993)) ([a843926](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/commit/a8439261949f00c18f2a761518036a9756676235)):
  - **Support for Centralized AMI**:  Allows customers to use a centralized DevOps account for building and hosting AMIs so that these AMIs can be made available to multiple SWB installations.
    - `enableAmiSharing` and `devopsProfile` configuration settings have been added, disabled by default. These can be overriden in your `main/config/settings/<stage>.yml` file.
  - **Restrict access to data for Admin Role**: The admin will be allowed to view another researchers' workspaces in the Service Workbench portal, but will not be able connect to them. This ensures the admins do not get indirect access to data sources of other users. Admins can also be restricted to being BYOB data source owners without being a BYOB study admins.
    - `restrictAdminWorkspaceConnection` and `disableAdminBYOBSelfAssignment` configuration settings have been added, disabled by default. These can be overriden in your `main/config/settings/<stage>.yml` file.
  - **Restricted data upload capabilities for Researcher Profile**: Users with a researcher role will not have the ability to create a study or upload files to any study, allowing organization to have more control over the study creation and data ingestion.
    - `disableStudyUploadByResearcher` configuration setting has been added, disabled by default. This can be overriden in your `main/config/settings/<stage>.yml` file.

  For more information about these flags, please take a look at our [User Guide](./docs/Service_Workbench_User_Guide.pdf) document.

## [5.0.0](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/compare/v4.3.1...v5.0.0) (2022-02-11)

## Internal Auth deprecation
* Starting with this release, internal authentication provider in Service Workbench will remain deprecated. Logging into Service Workbench using the legacy internal authentication route will not work.
* Resources owned by `internal` users need to be deactivated or their ownership needs to be transferred to native Cognito user pool/external IdP users. Users marked with an `internal` auth provider will need to be deactivated. Please follow the detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/blob/mainline/docs/docs/installation_guide/upgrading/authentication.md) for a smooth upgrade experience.

### [**4.2.0**](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/compare/v4.1.3...v4.2.0) (2022-01-19)
## Enhanced default authentication method
Starting with the Service Workbench 4.2.0 release, the native Amazon Cognito user pool is the default authentication method, and is reflected accordingly on the application's login page (alongside your external SAML IdP integrations, if any). 

Note: As a security enhancement, the internal authentication method used by Service Workbench (the legacy default authentication method) will soon be deprecated. 
For more information, read [Using native Amazon Cognito user pool for authentication](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/blob/mainline/docs/docs/configuration_guide/workflow.md)

### Customer Impact:
* You will find the default (user-customizable) configurations determining the native Amazon Cognito user pool behavior in the `main/solution/post-deployment/config/settings/.defaults.yml` file. 
* If using native Amazon Cognito user pool, users can sign up for a user account, but can not access Service Workbench until they are approved by the application admin. The user addition experience on Service Workbench for native Amazon Cognito user pool is similar to that of an external IdP.
* A new admin user would be created in Service Workbench using the `rootUserEmail` value as provided by your stage configuration. A temporary password will be available in the installation summary necessary for logging the native admin user in for the first time.
* You can still log in using the `internal` authentication method by adding the text `/?internal` to your Service Workbench URL (for eg. `https://<random_string>.cloudfront.net/?internal`).

### Important
* We suggest creating new users in native Amazon Cognito user pool (or an external IdP, if you use one) corresponding to their internal auth counterparts, and migrating resource permissions over to these new users.

### Features
* Implementation for Cognito Native Pool feature ([#858](_https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/pull/858_)) ([44dd9a6](_https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/commit/44dd9a6056bd7e3a0fd5f2f582726ba991da8a85_)).
### Bug Fixes

### Documentation

- rstudio doc updates ([#827](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/pull/827)) ([772617f](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/commit/772617f1888a25fd91b884121d98f23612a28f48))

## [4.1.0](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/compare/v4.0.2...v4.1.0) (2021-11-19)

### Features

- Implementation for RstudioV2 (backed by ALB) feature ([#807](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/pull/807)) ([ed2e7dc](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/commit/ed2e7dc60a35a12a8f14f55964ade66a88e38298)). In this release, RStudio ALB workspace type is provided with the following new features:

  - Compatibility with TRE (AppStream and Egress) features. See [Prepare your account for AppStream](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/blob/mainline/docs/docs/deployment/post_deployment/aws_accounts.md#prepare-your-account-for-appstream).
  - New input parameter **ACMSSLCertARN** has been introduced in the RStudio workspace type template. The template is created by the scripts provided in AWS partner’s repository. **ACMSSLCertARN** corresponds to the certificates of the custom domain present in the hosting account.
  - The **AmiID** parameter value can be retrieved by creating a new AMI using the scripts provided in AWS [partner’s repository](https://github.com/RLOpenCatalyst/Service_Workbench_Templates).
  - A common [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) (ALB) has been provided in the hosting account. See [Application load balancing for RStudio ALB workspace](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/blob/mainline/docs/docs/deployment/post_deployment/aws_accounts.md#application-load-balancing-for-rstudio-alb-workspace).
  - Allows you to leverage the automatic certificate refresh feature from [AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html) (ACM). As a result, you need not manually import the certificates into your main account ACM or hosting account ACM.
  - Note: With this release, the support for legacy RStudio workspace type has been deprecated. Please terminate legacy RStudio environment instances, if you have any.

- Add pending filter tab under AWS Accounts page ([#786](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/issues/786)) ([831da13](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/commit/831da13e4df32d3da67101f9065c109351f9b38c))

### Features

- Egress, Secured Workspaces (AppStream) and Account update wizard ([#750](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/issues/750)) ([b990924](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/commit/b99092458c7ee11f9b7540f7d1bbf898dd90744f))

Service Workbench is incrementing a major release version to bring attention to three new features.

#### 1. Member account onboarding improvement

The Service Workbench member account onboarding process is changed to be more in line with the Bring Your Own Bucket (BYOB) process. The general intent is that the process to onboard an account in support of hosting data should be the same as onboarding an account in support of hosting researcher workspace compute. Twelve points of context switching and manual data entry have been eliminated with the new process.

This change applies to all updated installations, and can be applied to those installations that have already onboarded member accounts.

To learn more about the new process, refer to the updated [instructions](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/blob/mainline/docs/Service_Workbench_Post_Deployment_Guide.pdf) in the Service Workbench Post Deployment guide.

**Important Notes:**

<<<<<<< HEAD

- If you have already onboarded a member account for your Service Workbench installation, and this account has active or stopped workspaces, the safest course would be to terminate all workspaces prior to the update. We did test a scenario with active and stopped workspaces and observed no impact during testing, but because this update is a major release, we recommend the safest course.
- # Any member accounts that were onboarded prior to this update will need to be updated through the Service Workbench user interface, and you will be prompted to do so when visiting the new “Accounts” page in Service Workbench. This update is necessary because there is a new capability that will check to see if the member and main account code versions are in sync, and provide a visual indicator if not, allowing you a clear indication of update.

* If you have already onboarded a member account for your Service Workbench installation, and this account has active or stopped workspaces, the safest course would be to terminate all workspaces prior to the update. We did test a scenario with active and stopped workspaces and observed no impact during testing, but because this update is a major release, we recommend the safest course.
* After updating the member account, delete the old workspace types and import the new workspace types. This is needed because the old workspace types may not work correctly with Service Workbench 4.0.0.

#### 2. Enabling secure desktop

Introduction of [AppStream 2.0](https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/) as an access point for Service Workbench workspaces. With this enabled, researchers will not be able to egress the data from their Service Workbench workspaces to their client machine, and Service Workbench workspaces will not have access to the internet.

Core networking changes within the member account will move researcher workspaces to the private subnets, and the method of connecting to a researcher workspace changes. Restricting access by public IP is no longer available, and the layer of security per workspace that replaces IP restriction is outlined in connection instructions in the Service Workbench workspace UI.

This feature is disabled by default upon install. To enable this feature, change the feature flag `isAppStreamEnabled` in the [configuration file](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/blob/mainline/main/config/settings/.defaults.yml#L204) to `true`.

**Important Notes:**

- _Once this feature is enabled for a Service Workbench installation, it cannot be disabled without deleting the installation and reinstalling._ This is because there are core networking changes for workspaces that cannot be reverted.
- If you have an existing installation without the feature flag enabled, and want to activate this feature flag, terminate all workspaces prior to activating the flag.
- AppStream service use does incur additional cost and we recommend you review the cost impact prior to configuring your AppStream fleet: https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/pricing/
- Because the Service Workbench workspaces do not have internet connectivity, [VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html) are introduced for all AWS services that the workspaces use (such as S3, EC2, and AppStream).
- Significant updates to the post deployment configuration instructions when this feature is enabled are outlined [here](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/blob/mainline/docs/Service_Workbench_Post_Deployment_Guide.pdf)

#### 3. Enabling secure egress

As a compliment to the Secure Desktop functionality, this feature provides a mount point per workspace (that is only accessible from that workspace) for a researcher to stage data that they wish to take out of the Service Workbench installation. Once the data is put to this location (called the Egress Store), the researcher can choose the _Submit Egress Request_ button and a message is generated to a SNS Topic (https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) containing the metadata for their egress request.

Like the Secure Desktop feature, this feature is also disabled by default upon install. To enable this feature, you must change the feature flag `enableEgressStore` in the [configuration file](https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/blob/mainline/main/config/settings/.defaults.yml#L184) to `true`. Note that this feature flag is independent from the Secure Desktop feature flag, but if it is activated by itself, there is nothing preventing the researcher from copying data to their local client (thus outside the egress store).

**Important Notes:**

- Currently, the message goes to the SNS topic - but there is not subscriber added to the topic. It is your responsibility to subscribe to the topic, and to act on the Egress Store data source with elevated permissions through the AWS Management Console.
- When this feature is enabled, the Bring Your Own Buckets (BYOB) data sources are only allowed to be read only. This is because a BYOB data source can live in a different AWS account (unlike MyStudy and Organizational Study that live in the main Service Workbench main account). Allowing write to a BYOB data source would be uncontrolled egress.

## [3.0.0] - 2021-04-19

### Added

- refactor: restricting AppDeployer permissions
- refactor: Remove permission boundary condition on launch constraint role
- refactor: restrict sc roles

**Permissions boundaries are being added to the several important IAM roles used by Service Workbench as a security best practice.**

**Customer Impact:** Below outlines the actions required for you to successfully adopt this security enhancement. The first two items are applicable to all customers. If you have created custom workspace types, then all three items below are applicable.

1. After running the update, onboard all hosting accounts once again to benefit from the enhanced security, and test the application.
   **Note:** The attached pdf contains steps for onboarding hosting accounts, contact your Service Workbench Administrator if you have not performed these steps before.

2. After running the update, import and use the newly available Service Catalog product versions for workspace types (latest version numbers) to benefit from the enhanced security.

3. **ONLY Customers that have created custom workspace types:** It is possible that the permissions boundaries would prevent actions that were formerly allowed. You should plan to validate your custom workspace types after the update. Issues should be addressed by modifying the custom workspaces to work within the permissions granted, or modify the permissions boundary for your installation (this would require a change to Service Workbench code (specifically the IAM policies that are attached as the permissions boundary) for your install).
   Note: Any existing custom or non-custom workspaces types (for example, EC2 Linux/Windows, EMR, SageMaker, R Studio) are not impacted by this upgrade.
