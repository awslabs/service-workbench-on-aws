The initial prerequisites include creating a **Main** account in AWS and setting up the **AWS Cost Explorer**.

- **Main Account**: 
Main account is the AWS account where Service Workbench will be deployed. This account is billed for all resources deployed by user accounts that are linked to it. 


- **AWS Cost Explorer**: 
To see the actual cost in dashboards and workspaces, you must set up a master account in AWS Cost Explorer. The master account holds the AWS Organization which creates member accounts.
