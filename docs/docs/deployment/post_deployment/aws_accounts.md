After logging in as **root** user for the first time, go to the '**Accounts**' page in the [SideBar](/user_guide/introduction). Service Workbench uses AWS accounts on this page for launching research workspaces. You can add existing AWS accounts or create new ones on the '**Accounts**' tab.  Accounts are responsible for the charges incurred by the resources that are deployed within the Service Workbench.

* **Create AWS Account**: Creates a new AWS account using AWS Organizations.

* **Add AWS Account**: Imports an existing AWS account, which will be responsible for its own billing.

Every user is linked to an **Account** through a **Project** and an **Index**, so at least one account must be created or added before creating the first user.

_**Important:** If you do not need to create new AWS accounts from within Service Workbench, then skip to the next section, 'Add AWS Account' section below._


## Create or add compute hosting accounts

After logging in as the root user for the first time, go to the **Accounts** page.

Service Workbench uses AWS accounts on this page for launching research workspaces. You can add existing AWS accounts or create new ones on the **Accounts** tab.

+ **Create AWS Account**: Creates a new AWS account using AWS Organizations.  Note that [Preparing the organizational account](/deployment/reference/prepare_master_account) steps outlined above are a pre-requisite should you require this capability.

+ **Add AWS Account**: Associates an existing AWS account for purposes of hosting compute resources.  This account can be responsible for its own billing.

Every user is linked to an account through a project and an index, so at least one account must be created or added before associating the first user to a project.

**Note**: If you do not need to create new AWS accounts from within Service Workbench, then skip to Add AWS Account section.

## Create AWS Account

### Prerequisites


Before creating an AWS account from Service Workbench, configure an existing AWS account to be the organizational account for Service Workbench (steps outlined in [Preparing the organizational account](/deployment/reference/prepare_master_account) above). When Service Workbench creates new AWS accounts, billing for those accounts is applicable to the organizational account.

### Creating a new Account
This creates a new hosting AWS account in the organization, whose billing goes to the organizational account. 
 
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/deployment/post_deployment/newacc1.png')} />

_**Figure: Create a new hosting account**_

To create an account:

1. In the Service Workbench console, choose **AWS Accounts** and then choose **Create AWS Account**.

     + In **Role ARN**, enter the **Master Role ARN** copied from the [Preparing the organizational account](/deployment/reference/prepare_master_account) steps.
     + The email address that you specify here must be unique within the organization.
     + The External ID is workbench by default. See [IAM](/deployment/reference/aws_services#Organizations) for information on how to configure this to another value.
2. During processing, the following information displays in the **AWS Accounts** tab:
     + ‘Trying to create accountID: xxx’
     + A workflow in progress in **Workflows > Provision Account** (see [Workflows](http://swb-documentation.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/user_guide/sidebar/admin/workflows/introduction)

     **Note**: If instead you see an error message such as, `Stop Internal State Account ID not found`, check that there is an AWS Organization in the console of your organizational account, if deploying Service Workbench in the organizational account. If you are deploying in a member account, check and ensure that you followed the steps described in [Preparing the organizational account](/deployment/reference/prepare_master_account).

     + Optionally, in the console, you can inspect the following resources deployed by this script.
         - In AWS CloudFormation, a stack prep-master is running. It creates the master role and its output is the master role ARN.
         - In AWS Organizations, in the organizational account (see IAM), the new account displays. 
         - In IAM, the new master role is created.
3.	Once the account is created, it is listed in AWS Accounts.



## Add AWS Account

Adding an existing AWS account enables Service Workbench to launch research workspaces. The existing account alignment (standalone or associated to an an organization) determines the billing responsibility.

1.	On the **Accounts** Page, choose **AWS Accounts**, and then choose **Add AWS Account**.

     <img src={useBaseUrl('img/deployment/post_deployment/addacc1.png')} /> 
 
     _**Figure: Add an existing account**_

2.	Create and run the AWS CloudFormation template.

### If AppStream is not enabled

+ Enter the **Account Name**, **Account ID** (12-digit AWS account ID for the account you wish to add), and **Description**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/deployment/post_deployment/addacc2.png')} />

_**Figure: Specify account details**_

+ The **Onboard AWS Account** screen is displayed, where you can select either of the following options:

     - **I have admin access** : You have administrator-level access to the hosting account that is being onboarded.  Selecting this and then proceeding launches the CloudFormation template within the hosting account.  Note that you need to be logged into the AWS account console for the hosting account when selecting this option and proceeding.
     - **I do not have admin access** : The CloudFormation template is generated and you can then share the template to be run by the party that does have administrator access in the AWS account that you are onboarding.

### If AppStream is enabled


If you have chosen to enable AppStream for your installation, there are additional values required when onboarding a hosting account.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/deployment/post_deployment/appstream1.png')} />


_**Figure: Add account when AppStream is enabled**_

+ **AppStream Fleet Desired Instance**: The maximum number of concurrently running AppStream sessions allowed.  If you set this to 5, that would mean that five workspaces can be viewed concurrently.
+ **AppStreamDisconnectTimeoutSeconds**: With a minimum of 60 seconds, this is the amount between a researcher disconnection from a session (Manual Stop, Auto Stop, or Terminate) and the release of the AppStream instance that is supporting that session.
+ **AppStreamIdleDisconnectTimeoutSeconds**: The amount of time that an AppStream session idle time (meaning no activity within the session) before the AppStream instance disconnects.
 
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/deployment/post_deployment/appstream2.png')} />

_**Figure: Add account when AppStream is enabled (contd..)**_


+ **AppStreamMaxUserDurationSeconds**:  The maximum amount of time for an AppStream session.
+ **AppStreamImageName**: The exact image name produced when you follow the instructions to build your AppStream image.
+ **AppStreamInstanceType**: The instance type for your AppStream fleet.  Note that these instance types are unique to AppStream.  A complete list and specifications for valid instance types is available at https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/pricing/ 
+ **AppStreamFleetType**: `ALWAYS_ON` ensures that the desired number of instances remain available at all times.  `ON_DEMAND` only runs the instances when required.  It is a cost versus convenience choice.

**Note**:  If you needed to change these values later, you can do so through the AWS Console of the hosting account without negative impact to Service Workbench.


Once these options are specified, choosing **Onboard Account** displays the **Onboard AWS Account** screen.  The same choice of admin vs. no admin access applies, but there are several important pre-requisites to complete before proceeding.


## Prepare your account for AppStream

AWS AppStream service limits may block resource creation in a new AWS account, or an account that has not yet hosted AppStream resources.  The following actions will best prepare the hosting account.


1. **Required**: Go to AppStream 2.0 services (AWS Console), and choose Get Started. This will take you to a screen asking if you want to try out some templates. At this screen choose Next. This will only need to be done once for the account (it activates a role required for AppStream to be initiated).
2. **Recommended**: Launch at least one EC2 instance (size of instance and duration of run prior to termination do not matter), as this establishes the base compute service limits.
3. **Optional**: Open a support ticket within the hosting account to AWS AppStream service, noting your intention to create a fleet.  This should only be necessary if you are creating a large fleet, but if the account is very new or has never had resources created prior to being onboarded as a hosting account, this is recommended.

Once prerequisites are complete and the CloudFormation stack has been created, go to AppStream on the AWS console of the hosting account. Go to **Fleet** and then choose the newly created fleet. Choose **Action**>**Start** to start the fleet.  This step must be completed for any researcher workspace to be successfully launched within the hosting account.

After proceeding from the Onboard AWS Account Screen, you will be returned to the Account listing page with a status.

+ **Up to Date** : The account has successfully onboarded and the version of the main and hosting account code is in sync.
+ **Needs Update** : This status means that the main account code is more up to date than the hosting account code.  There is an update button available and it is advised that you use this to bring the hosting account to the latest version.
+ **Needs Onboarding** : The account has been onboarded via the Service Workbench UI but the cloudformation template has not been generated
+ **Errored** : The onboarding of the hosting account failed. Check the cloudformation stack in the hosting account.
+ **Pending** : The account onboarding process is ongoing.  If a hosting account remains in pending status beyond 30 minute, it is likely that there is an issue onboarding the account. Check the CloudFormation stack in the hosting account.



## Setting up an AppStream Image

### Overview


This section describes the procedure of setting up an AppStream image with the following applications installed: Firefox, Notepad, PuttyGen, and Putty. AppStream should be built in the main account. To do this:

+ Launch an AppStream Image Builder instance.
+ Log in to the AppStream Image builder instance and run a script to build an image with Firefox, PuttyGen, Putty, and Notepad.

### Pre-requisites

1.	Navigate to AWS AppStream in your main account using the AWS Management Console.
2.	Choose **Get Started** and then choose **Next**. This activates AppStream in your main account, following which you could proceed with the commands in `SETUP.md` file.

### Launching an AppStream Image Builder instance

1. Navigate to the `scripts/app-stream` directory.
2. Enter the following commands:
     ```
     npm install
     npm run start-image-builder 
     -- <AWS Profile> <region> <Base image name> <instance size>

     # Example: npm run start-image-builder -- default us-east-1 
     AppStream-WinServer2019-06-01-2021 stream.standard.medium

     # If preferred you can choose the default base image name and instance size by running this command: 

     npm run start-image-builder -- default us-east-1 default default 
     ```

     **Note**: Set up your AWS profile beforehand so that you have permission to launch an AppStream Image Builder instance in your AWS Account. 

3. Once the Image Builder is launched and ready, choose the URL provided in the terminal console. This opens the AppStream page on the AWS Management Console.


### Building AppStream image

_**Figure: Create an AppStream image**_

1. On the AppStream page in the console, choose the AppStream image that was built in the previous step and choose **Connect**.
2. This opens a new tab in your browser. When prompted, log in as administrator. This opens the Windows Desktop that you can interact with to create your AppStream image.
3. On the Windows Desktop, choose **Start** and enter `Windows Powershell`.
4. Right-click the application and choose **Run as administrator**.
5. Enter the following commands:
     ```
     \cd ~\Documents

     # Pull the Image Builder script from Github
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws/mainline/scripts/app-stream/buildImage.ps1 -OutFile buildImage.ps1

     # Execute Image builder script
     .\buildImage.ps1
     ```
6.	At this point, the Image builder builds your image and the `Failed to reserve a session` message is displayed. 
7.	Log in to AppStream on the console and wait till the AppStream image is built.
