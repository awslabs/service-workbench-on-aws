Now that you have onboarded a hosting account, you can create indexes and projects associated to this account.

**Projects** and **Indexes** form a hierarchy under **Accounts**. Each account can have multiple **Indexes**, each **Index** can have multiple **Projects**. **Projects** are attached to **Users**, so you must create the **Projects** first.

After you create an [Account](/deployment/post_deployment/link_aws_account) in the **Accounts** tab of the administrative interface, create an **Index** that links to the account, by selecting the **Account ID** from the drop-down. 

1.	On the **Indexes** tab, choose **Add Index**.
