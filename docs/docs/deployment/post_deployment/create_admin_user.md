Once you create an [Account](/deployment/post_deployment/link_aws_account) and an [Index and Project](/deployment/post_deployment/create_index_project), you must create an administrator user in the ‘**Users**’ tab. See **Figure 7**.

_**Note**: A root user account will already be created, however, you must not routinely use the root user account._
