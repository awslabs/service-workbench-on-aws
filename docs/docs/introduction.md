Service Workbench is an open-source solution for researchers to deploy data and tools on secure IT environments in minutes. It provides a centralized location to search for data sets and deploy research workspaces within them. Researchers in an organization can access a portal, quickly find data that they are interested in, with a few clicks, analyze data using machine learning service such as the [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) notebooks, or even manage and facilitate virtual classrooms. The Service Workbench platform provides one-click option to system administrators for easier creation (vending) of new AWS accounts specific to their research teams for easier governance.

Service Workbench also allows an organization to provide access of their data sets, or a subset of their data sets, to external organizations in a controlled way. Further to this, the external organization can use their own AWS account for research workspace and access data in the hosting organization.
