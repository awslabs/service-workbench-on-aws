You can install Service Workbench either by creating and configuring an EC2 instance or by creating a Cloud9 instance. This section describes the steps to install Service Workbench by using either of the two options.

### Installing AMIs for EC2 Workspace

In order to use EC2-based Workspaces, you must Ô¨Årst install EC2 AMIs for these Workspaces. This process may be run in parallel while `environment-deploy.sh` is running. To run both simultaneously, open another SSH or SSM session to your EC2 instance.
1. Build AMIs for EC2-based Workspaces. This takes up to 15 minutes and may run in parallel with the main install script.
     a. Install packer from the root of your home directory:
     b.	Change to the directory containing the machine image source and build the AMIs. Ensure that the environment variable `STAGE_NAME` has been set before running this command. 
2.	Verify that the AMIs have been created:
In the Amazon EC2 service console, select AMI in the left-hand navigation. You should see AMIs for EC2-LINUX, EC2-RSTUDIO, EC2-WINDOWS, and Amazon EMR.

**Warning**: Each AMI build results in a new set of AMIs.
