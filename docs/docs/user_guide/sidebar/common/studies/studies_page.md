The Studies page provides a central location for creating Studies, uploading files, managing Study permissions, and creating new Workspaces.

### Changing organization-categorized Study permissions
To change permissions for an organization's Study:

1.	Click the **Permissions** button for the Study.
2.	Click the pencil icon beside the Users level.
3.	Update permissions as needed.

**Note**: Changing a userâ€™s permissions for an external Study results in all existing workspaces for that user losing all access to the Study. This will be addressed in a future release.

### Creating a Study and uploading files
To create a Study:

1.	Click **Create Study**.
2.	Enter a unique ID, type (My study or Organization Study), Name, Description, and Project ID.
3.	Click **Create Study**.

To upload files:

1.	Click **Upload Files**.
2.	Either drag and drop the files you want to upload, or click the **Browse Files** button to select the files to upload.

**Note**: The **Upload Files** button is not visible if you lack write permissions to the Study, or if the Study is external.
