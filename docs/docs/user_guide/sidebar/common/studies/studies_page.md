The Studies page provides a central location for creating Studies, uploading files, managing Study permissions, and creating new Workspaces.

### Changing organization-categorized Study permissions
To change permissions for an organization's Study:

1.	Click the **Permissions** button for the Study.
2.	Click the pencil icon beside the Users level.
3.	Update permissions as needed.

**Note**: Changing a userâ€™s permissions for an external study results in all existing workspaces for that user losing all access to the study. The previously assigned external study permission in a given user's workspace could prevail throughout any ongoing sessions before such a loss of access occurs. Therefore in the scenario of study permission revocation for a given user, please have an SWB admin stop and start those users' workspaces (if any) which have that external study mounted.

### Creating a Study and uploading files
To create a Study:

1.	Click **Create Study**.
2.	Enter a unique ID, type (My study or Organization Study), Name, Description, and Project ID.
3.	Click **Create Study**.

To upload files:

1.	Click **Upload Files**.
2.	You can upload files either by dragging and dropping, or by clicking the **Upload Files** or **Upload Folder** button.

**Note**: The **Upload Files** button is not visible if you lack write permissions to the Study, or if the Study is external.
