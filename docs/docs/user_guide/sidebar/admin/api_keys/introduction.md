Service Workbench enables an organization to provide researchers with a centralized location to search for data sets and deploy research workspaces with them. Research can access a portal, quickly find data that they are interested in and with a few clicks be analyzing it in SageMaker Notebooks, for example.

Service Workbench also allows an organization to provide access to their data sets, or a subset of their data sets, to external organizations in a controlled way. Further to this, the external organization can use their own AWS account for the research workspace and access the data in the hosting organization.
