You can add [**Users**](../../users/introduction.md) to a Project. This enables that user to access [**Studies**](../../../common/studies/introduction.md) and deploy [**Workspaces**](../../../common/workspaces/introduction.md) in the Project. To add a User to a Project, follow these steps:

1. In the portal navigate to the **Users** page using the menu on the left.
2. Click the **Detail** button for the User you want to add the Project to.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. From the **Project** field, select the projects that you want to grant access to.
5. Click the **Save** button.
