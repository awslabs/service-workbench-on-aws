Once you have created an [Account](/deployment/post_deployment/link_aws_account) and an [Index and Project](/deployment/post_deployment/create_index_project),
create an administrative user in the **Users** tab. There will already
be a root user created, but this account should not routinely be used.

Give the user an **admin** role, associate them with the Project you
created, and set the status to **Active**.
