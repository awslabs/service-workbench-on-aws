The dashboard is visible to all users that log in to the solution. It is also the first screen visible to a user after logging into the web interface. Based on the role a user holds they can see more or less data inside the dashboard's widgets.

The dashboard displays:

* The [**Index**](../../admin/accounts/indexes/introduction) costs for the past 30 days. This is the cost, a certain index or cost center has allotted over the course of the last rolling 30 days. This includes all workspaces started for this index, regardless of the user who started or owns them.
* The [**Workspaces**](../../common/workspaces/introduction.md) costs for the past 30 days. This represents the workspaces owned by the specific, logged in, user over the course of the last 30 days.
* Yesterday's [**Workspaces**](../../common/workspaces/introduction.md) costs.
* A breakdown of the [**Index**](../../admin/accounts/indexes/introduction) costs for the past 30 days per user.
