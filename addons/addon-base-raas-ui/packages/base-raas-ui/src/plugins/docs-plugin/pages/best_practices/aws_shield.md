A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is an attack in which multiple compromised systems attempt to flood a target, such as a network or web application, with traffic. A DDoS attack can prevent legitimate users from accessing a service and can cause the system to crash due to the overwhelming traffic volume.

AWS provides two levels of protection against DDoS attacks: AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced. For production workloads we recommend that you enable and configure AWS Shield Advanced.

For more information see the [**How AWS Shield works**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-overview.html) documentation.
