/**
 * A decision to pause Step. This decision is very similar to the WaitDecision.
 * The WaitDecision is intended to be used for situation when the Step is in-progress and waiting for some condition
 * to become true. From StepLoop's perspective the Step is considered to be still in-progress while waiting so
 * the StepLoop does not fire any status change related events.
 *
 * In case of the PauseDecision the Step is considered to be transitioning from "in_progress" status to a explicitly
 * "paused" state. From StepLoop's perspective the Step is considered to be transitioning from "in_progress" to
 * "paused" status so the StepLoop fires step status change related events. See "../step-loop.js" for more details.
