# @aws-ee/base-docs

This package provides a helper ([./lib/docs-registration-util.js](./lib/docs-registration-util)) to enable plugins throughout the solution to contribute assets and configuration for a Docusaurus site.

It also provides base assets and configuration for all cross-cutting documentation that is not specific to another add-on package or SDC.
