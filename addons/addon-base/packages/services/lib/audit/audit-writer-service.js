  /**
   * Audit method responsible for writing the specified audit event. The method calls plugins for the "audit" extension
   * point. Plugins are called and awaited in the same order as returned by the plugin registry.
   *
   * The method first prepares the given event by calling the "prepare" method of the plugins. Each plugin gets a chance
   * to contribute to preparing the given audit event. The plugins can return the given audit event as is or modify it
   * and return prepared audit event. The audit event returned by the last plugin from the "prepare" method is used as
   * the effective audit event.
   *
   * After audit event is prepared, it writes the audit event by calling the "write" method of the plugins. Each plugin
   * gets a chance to write the given audit event to their respective persistent layer.
   *
   * The method returns a promise that resolves only after all plugins for "audit" extension point are resolved
   * (i.e., after the event has been written by all audit writer plugins). If any plugin throws an error, the method
   * stops calling further plugins and fails (i.e., returns a Promise that rejects with the same error).
   *
   * @param requestContext The request context object containing principal (caller) information.
   * The principal's identifier object is expected to be available as "requestContext.principalIdentifier"
   *
   * @param auditEvent The audit event.
   * @param auditEvent.action The action that is being audited.
   * @param auditEvent.body The body containing some information about the audit event. The body can be any javascript
   * object containing extra information about the audit event.
   * @param auditEvent.message Optional user friendly string message. This defaults to "auditEvent.action", if missing.
   * @param auditEvent.actor Optional JavaScript object containing information about the actor who is performing the
   * specified action. This defaults to the "requestContext.principalIdentifier" and should NOT be specified in most
   * cases.
   * @param auditEvent.timestamp Optional timestamp when the event occurred. This defaults to current time. The
   * "auditEvent.timestamp" is in Epoch Unix timestamp format.
   *
   * @param args Additional arguments to pass to the plugins for the "audit" extension point.
   *
   * @returns {Promise<{auditEvent: *, status: string}>}

   * - The method fires writing audit event using the plugins and returns right away. The method returns a Promise that
   * resolve immediately (i.e., does not wait for all plugins to finish writing)
   * - In case, any plugin fails writing audit event, the method ignores that error and continues invoking other plugins
