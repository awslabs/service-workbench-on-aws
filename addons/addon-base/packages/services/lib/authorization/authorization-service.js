  /**
   * Main authorization method responsible for authorizing the specified action.
   *
   * @param requestContext The request context object containing principal (caller) information.
   * The principal's identifier object is expected to be available as "requestContext.principalIdentifier" and the
   * principal object is expected to be available as "requestContext.principal"
   *
   * @param extensionPoint Name of authorization extension point specific to the resource for which the authorization
   * needs to be performed. The method invokes all plugins registered to the specified extension point giving them a
   * chance to perform their authorization logic.
   * -- The plugins are called in the same order as returned by the registry.
   * -- Each plugin is passed a plain JavaScript object containing the authorization result evaluated so far from previous plugins.
   * -- Each plugin gets a chance to inspect the authorization result collected so far and return authorization effect as
   * "allow" or "deny". i.e., each subsequent plugin has a chance to loosen or tighten the permissions returned by previous
   * plugins.
   * -- The authorization result with effect returned from the last plugin will be used as an effective authorization answer.
   * These plugins are expected to implement "authorize" method. The method may be sync or async (i.e., it may return a promise).
   * If it returns promise, it is awaited before calling the next plugin.
   *
   * @param resource The resource for which the authorization needs to be performed (Optional).
   *
   * @param action The action for which the authorization needs to be performed
   *
   * @param conditions Optional condition function or an array of functions. All conditions are assumed to be connected
   * by AND i.e., all condition functions must return "allow" for the action to be authorized. These functions are
   * invoked with the same arguments that the authorizer plugin is invoked with. i.e.,
   * "(requestContext, container, permissionsSoFar, ...args)".
   * The "permissionsSoFar" is permissions returned by the previous function in the array. It is an object with the
   * shape {resource, action, effect, reason}. These condition functions can be sync or async
   * (i.e., they can return a Promise). If the function returns a promise, it is awaited first before calling the next
   * function in the array. (i.e., the next function is not invoked until the returned promise either resolves or rejects).
   * The effective permissions as a result of evaluating all conditions (with implicit AND between them) is passed to
   * the plugins registered against the specified "extension-point". These plugins can inspect these permissions and
   * return permission as is or change it. In other words, the plugins can override permissions resulted by evaluating
   * the conditions. This allows the plugins to loosen/tighten permissions as per their requirements.
   *
   * @param args Additional arguments to pass to the plugins for the specified extension point. These arguments are also
   * passed to the condition functions.
   *
   * @returns {Promise<{reason, effect: string}>} A promise that resolves to effective permissions for the specified
   * action and principal (the principal information is retrieved from requestContext)
