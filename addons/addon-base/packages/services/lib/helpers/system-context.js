/**
 * A helper function that helps create requestContext for system users.
 * Most of the services accept "requestContext" argument which provides context about the service call (such as who is the caller of the service i.e., the "principal" etc)
 * In case of system calls (i.e., calls not initiated by any "principal" but result of some system operation such as execution of post-deployment steps),
 * the requestContext should contain information about the implicit "system" user.
 * This method returns this "requestContext" that can be passed to services for system calls.
