/**
 * First of all, a services container has nothing to do with Docker.
 *
 * A services container is simply an instance of a JavaScript class that runs inside a node.js unix process.
 *
 * It is a container of services that has two main responsibilities:
 * - A registry for the Service class instances.
 * - Initializing the services on demand.
 *
 * This is a low level class that you usually do not interact with directly with the exception of calling
 * the `register()` method. Higher level abstractions, such as the API Framework and the Service class, hide most of the
 * interactions with this class from the rest of your service classes.
 *
 * **Usage**
