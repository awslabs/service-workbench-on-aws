Outputs:
  NotebookInstanceName:
    Description: The name of the SageMaker notebook instance.

  #  Connection related outputs. These outputs need to have prefix "MetaConnection"
  #  The "connections" are derived based on the CFN outputs as follows.
  #
  #  CFN outputs with the OutputKey having format "MetaConnection<ConnectionAttrib>" or "MetaConnection<N><ConnectionAttrib>"
  #  are used for extracting connection information.
  #  - If the environment has only one connection then it can have outputs with "MetaConnection<ConnectionAttrib>" format.
  #  - If it has multiple connections then it can have outputs with "MetaConnection<N><ConnectionAttrib>" format.
  #  For example, MetaConnection1Name, MetaConnection2Name, etc.
  #
  #  The expected CFN output variables used for capturing connections related information are as follows:
  #
  #  - MetaConnectionName (or MetaConnection<N>Name) - Provides name for connection
  #
  #  - MetaConnectionUrl (or MetaConnection<N>Url) - Provides connection url, if available
  #
  #  - MetaConnectionScheme (or MetaConnection<N>Scheme) - Provides connection protocol information such as http, https, ssh, jdbc, odbc etc
  #
  #  - MetaConnectionType (or MetaConnection<N>Type) - Provides type of the connection such as "SageMaker", "EMR", "FOO", "BAR" etc
  #
  #  - MetaConnectionInfo (or MetaConnection<N>Info) - Provides extra information required to form connection url.
  #  For example, in case of MetaConnectionType = SageMaker, the MetaConnectionInfo should provide SageMaker notebook
  #  instance name that can be used to form pre-signed SageMaker URL.
  #
  #  - MetaConnectionInstanceId (or MetaConnection<N>InstanceId) - Provides AWS EC2 instanceId of the instance to connect to when applicable.
  #  Currently this is applicable only when ConnectionScheme = 'ssh'.
  #  This instanceId will be used for sending user's SSH public key using AWS EC2 Instance Connect when user wants to SSH to the instance.
  #
  MetaConnectionInfo:
    Description: The name of the SageMaker notebook instance.
    Value: !GetAtt [BasicNotebookInstance, NotebookInstanceName]

    Description: Type of environment this connection is for
    Value: SageMaker

  MetaConnectionName:
    Description: Name for this connection
    Value: SageMaker Notebook
