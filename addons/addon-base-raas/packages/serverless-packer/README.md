## Prerequisites

#### Tools

- Node 14.x or later
- [Hashicorp Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
  - The Service Workbench code is tested with Packer 1.6.0. You can install Packer 1.6.0 by using Packer version manager [pkenv](https://github.com/iamhsa/pkenv).

#### Project variables

All variables in the settings will be added as -var parameters into the packer build command

## Usage

When installed as a [Serverless plugin](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/plugins/), this provides the following CLI commands:

### `pnpx sls build-image -s <STAGE> [--file]`

By convention, this looks in the `./config/infra` directory for a json file that starts with packer. This file is then used by packer to build the AMI.
